<p id="info">In July of 2017 I began to get a strong interest into photography. I started small and was messing with settings on the in built camera on my phone, and slowly began to learn what each part did. After asking my Dad to teach me more about cameras he eventually let me have a go with his camera. From this moment I knew that I wanted to be a photographer.<br>I asked him if I could have a camera for my birthday, and on September 29th 2017 I opened my present from my Dad and step-mum, I now had my first camera. At first I was quite scared to break it and so was extremely careful with it, I had a Canon 550D with an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 and a Sigma 75-300mmf/4-5.6 which I use to this day.<br>About 3 months after getting my camera I went on holiday to Perth, Australia. I knew this would be a great place to practice with my camera and so started to learn about it from there. I took a 32GB memory card for the 2 weeks expecting it to be plenty. Because of my minimal understanding of how big the photos would actually be, I decided to save them in RAW format as I knew that would be the best quality. Unsuprisingly to most, I filled up that card within the first week.<br>Whilst over there I tried to take as many different types of photos as I could and even tried some long exposure photography. I struggled quite a lot with this as at the time I didn&apos;t have a tripod, luckily I met a very freindly person whilst I was trying to take these photos, he was also a new photographer trying to take similar photos to me, he showed me what worked for him and let me borrow his tripod to have a go myself. After talking with him for about 20 minutes and taking photos I realised I still had a lot to learn and so I kept practicing, which has gotten me here today.<br>Whilst I still go to college, I do not do photography as I was told by my previous school that most of my photos were ready for A&#8209;Level final pieces. I currently study Computer Science and continue photography as a hobby and for my local Parkrun event.
